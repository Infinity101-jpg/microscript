# microscript
MicroScript is a further abstraction for the Bicro:Bit to make it faster or easier to code. Currently still in version 0.0.1;

Put the compiler and any example file in the same folder, change the example name to "script.js", run the compiler, paste the output into the Micro:Bit Makecode program under Javascript, and run.
